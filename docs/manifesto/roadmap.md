# 🗺️ Strategic Roadmap

**"The Operating System for Enterprise AI Context."**

Our mission is to move from a "Data Governance Tool" to the global **Standard for Metric Provenance**.

---

## 📍 Phase 1: The Foundation (2025)
*Target: Data Engineers & Architects*

*   ✅ **The Open Protocol**: Release ODGS v1.0 (JSON Schema).
*   ✅ **The "Open Metric"**: Standardize KPI definitions across dbt and Power BI.
*   🔄 **Adoption**: Get developers to use ODGS because it adheres to **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself). Write logic once, sync everywhere.

## 🚀 Phase 2: The Control Plane (2026)
*Target: Data Stewards & Process Owners*

*   **Governance as Code**: Move from PDF policies to Git-based policy enforcement.
*   **Operational Intelligence**: Link data quality issues to business process failures ("The Check Engine Light for Ops").
*   **Definition Management**: A "GitHub for Business Logic" where Marketing and Finance collaborate on definitions.

## 🤖 Phase 3: The AI Ground Truth (2027)
*Target: Chief AI Officers & Regulators*

*   **Algorithmic Accountability**: ODGS becomes the standard "Safety Label" for Enterprise AI Agents.
*   **Automated Compliance**: One-click generation of EU AI Act audit reports.
*   **The "Context Engine"**: ODGS serves as the real-time semantic brain for autonomous agents.

## 🌍 Market Strategy: The "Trojan Horse"

1.  **Start with Utility**: Solve the "Metric Drift" problem for engineers today.
2.  **Upsell Control**: Sell the management layer to the enterprise tomorrow.
3.  **Own the Truth**: Become the trusted source of truth for the AI future.
